# Welcome to Lumyo API

The Lumyo API enables you to programmatically access our platform's functionality. This document provides comprehensive information about available endpoints, authentication methods, and best practices for integration.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to the following base URL:

```bash
https://api.lumyo.co
```

## Authentication

Lumyo uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can obtain your API key from the [Lumyo Dashboard](https://app.lumyo.co/settings).

Include your API key in all requests using the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer your_api_key
```

<Note>
  Keep your API keys secure. Do not share them in publicly accessible areas such
  as GitHub, client-side code, or in API requests to third-party services.
</Note>

## Rate Limiting

To ensure service stability, Lumyo API implements rate limiting 60 requests per minute. When you exceed your rate limit, the API will return a `429 Too Many Requests` response. The response headers include:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: [requests allowed per period]
X-RateLimit-Remaining: [requests remaining in period]
X-RateLimit-Reset: [UTC timestamp when limit resets]
```

## Request Format

The API accepts JSON-encoded request bodies. Set the Content-Type header accordingly:

```bash
Content-Type: application/json
```

## Response Format

All responses are returned in JSON format. Successful requests return HTTP status codes in the `2xx` range, typically `200 OK` or `201 Created`.

Error responses include HTTP status codes in the `4xx` or `5xx` range with a JSON body containing error details:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_parameter",
    "message": "The email parameter is invalid",
    "param": "email"
  }
}
```

Response headers include pagination metadata:

```
X-Total-Count: [total items]
X-Total-Pages: [total pages]
X-Current-Page: [current page]
```
